the dom is a structured representation of HTML document. It is a tree of nodes created by the browser. Using js, we can use edit these dom elemenrs/ nodes.

The dom is object oriented, ie each node has its own set of attributes and properties.

The browser gives us a window object and inside that we have a document object.
